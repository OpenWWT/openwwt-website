# AAS WorldWide Telescope website

This repository contains the code for the web services backing the
[AAS](https://aas.org/) [WorldWide
Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) software system.

**Note** The contents of this repository are in flux as we modernize this
codebase.

## Deprecated APIs

As we move the service to a more modern architecture, some endpoints are being deprecated. These include the following:
